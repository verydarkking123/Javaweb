App class : main entry @args first argument as the classname to be used in Parserfactory

Logical class : handle the different logical server for the customer, such as the task 1 and 2

ChanllengeOperation class : implement the required content of task 1 and 2, in my opionion, 
the both task want has the same goal to get the absolute value bettween two column ABS(column1, column2).
if we want to implement other function, just inherit this class.

Result class : try to put the return value of the logical operation in a container, which is called class Result. Since we may not only print the result, but also handle with it.

PaserFactory class : here use the java reflection. Using classname as argument, then we can dynamical choose the implementation of the FileParser. However,  the payoff is the running time

FileParser interface : general function to parser a file

CSVParser class : implementation of parsering the .csv file

JSONParser class : to be implemented
